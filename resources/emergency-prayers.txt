## EMERGENCY VERSE TO MEMORIZE

"No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it." - 1 Corinthians 10:13

## THE 5-SECOND RULE

When temptation hits, you have 5 seconds before it takes hold. In those 5 seconds:

1. SAY OUT LOUD: "Jesus, help me!"
2. LOOK AWAY immediately
3. MOVE your body (walk away, stand up, change rooms)
4. CALL someone (accountability partner, friend, family)
5. RECITE Scripture (1 Corinthians 10:13 or another memorized verse)

Don't give sin time to take root. Act in the first 5 seconds.
