We pray against the Spirit of lust within our hearts, minds, and bodies. We renounce all sexual sins, including fornication, masturbation, and pornography. In the name of Jesus Christ, we break all curses of lust and command all spirits of lust and perversion to come out of our lives. We take authority over our thoughts and bind all spirits of fantasy and lustful thinking. We receive the Spirit of holiness to walk in sexual purity. Lord, we ask for your strength and guidance to overcome these temptations. Fill us with the power of your Holy Spirit. In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen.\n\n---\n\nFeel free to use this prayer as a guide, and remember, you are not alone in this journey. If you need further support or resources, just let me know!"
