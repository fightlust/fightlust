      "msg": "It's great that you're seeking guidance on how to pray after struggling with masturbation. Here's a prayer model you can follow:\n\n1. **Confession**: Acknowledge your sin before God. You can say something like, \"Heavenly Father, I confess my struggle with masturbation and ask for Your forgiveness. I know it opens doors for the enemy, and I want to turn away from it.\"\n\n2. **Repentance**: Express your desire to change. \"Lord, I repent of this sin and ask for Your strength to overcome it. Help me to resist temptation and to seek You instead.\"\n\n3. **Supplication**: Ask for God's help. \"Please fill me with Your Holy Spirit and guide me in my journey towards purity. Help me to close any doors that I have opened to the enemy.\"\n\n4. **Thanksgiving**: Thank God for His forgiveness and support. \"Thank You, Lord, for Your grace and mercy. I trust in Your power to help me overcome.\"\n\nFeel free to personalize this prayer as you feel led. If you need more specific resources or prayers, let me know!"
