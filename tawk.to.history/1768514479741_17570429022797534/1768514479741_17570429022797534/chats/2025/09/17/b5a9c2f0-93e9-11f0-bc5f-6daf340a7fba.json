Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body.\"\n4. **Galatians 5:16** - \"But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.\"\n\nYou can incorporate these verses into your prayers for her deliverance.

In the name of Jesus Christ, we break all connections with those who lead us away from you and your truth.\n\nWe cast out all spirits of loneliness that may drive us to seek validation in harmful relationships.

We take authority over our thoughts and bind all spirits that would keep us in bondage to unhealthy influences.\n\nLord, we ask for your protection and healing. Fill us with your Holy Spirit and help us to seek relationships that uplift and encourage us in our walk with you. We thank you for your love and grace, and we trust in your power to restore and renew our lives.\n\nIn Jesus' name, we pray.

Here are some scriptures that you can use in prayer for your daughter's deliverance and healing:\n\n1. **Psalm 25:11** - \"For your name's sake, O LORD, pardon my guilt, for it is great.\"\n2. **Philippians 4:6-7** - \"Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.\"\n3. **Ephesians 6:12** - \"For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.\"\n4. **2 Corinthians 10:4-5** - \"For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh but have divine power to destroy strongholds. We destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God, and take every thought captive to obey Christ.\"\n\nFeel free to use these scriptures in your prayers for her. If you need more specific prayers or guidance, just let me know!"
