Here are some steps you can take:\n\n1. **Pursue Christ**: Instead of just seeking freedom, focus on knowing and beholding the beauty of the Lord. Spend time in prayer and in the Word of God.\n\n2. **Surrender**: Acknowledge that you cannot overcome this struggle on your own. Surrender your struggles to Jesus and ask for His help.\n\n3. **Seek Support**: Consider joining a support group or finding a mentor who can guide you through this journey.\n\n4. **Pray**: Regularly pray for strength and guidance. You can also use specific prayers that focus on overcoming temptation.\n\n5. **Stay in the Word**: Meditate on scriptures that remind you of God's love and strength. Psalms 90:14 says, \"Lord, satisfy us with your steadfast love in the morning, that we can rejoice and be glad all of our days.\"\n\nIf you would like more specific resources or prayers, just let me know!"
