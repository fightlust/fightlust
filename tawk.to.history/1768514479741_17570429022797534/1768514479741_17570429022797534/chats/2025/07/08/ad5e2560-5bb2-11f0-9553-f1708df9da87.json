Lord, she desires to be fully restored to You—delivered completely from all perversion and to walk again in intimacy with You. Father, You are mighty to save, and Your Word declares that whom the Son sets free is free indeed (John 8:36).\n\nWe pray right now for every stronghold of lust and perversion to be broken in Jesus’ name. We bind every spirit of bondage and cast it out by the authority of Christ. Holy Spirit, we ask You to fill every empty place with Your presence, peace, and power. Release purity, healing, and clarity over Jackie’s mind, body, and soul.\n\nAnd Lord, we intercede for her marriage. Where there’s pain, bring healing. Where there’s division, bring unity. Let the love of Christ reign in her home. Restore communication, trust, and spiritual oneness between Jackie and her spouse.\n\nStrengthen her walk, guard her heart, and lead her daily in paths of righteousness. Surround her with godly counsel, accountability, and the support of a church body that will walk with her in grace and truth.\n\nWe believe in Your promises, God. Jackie is not alone. You are with her, and Your plans for her are good.\n\nIn the powerful name of Jesus Christ we pray, amen."
