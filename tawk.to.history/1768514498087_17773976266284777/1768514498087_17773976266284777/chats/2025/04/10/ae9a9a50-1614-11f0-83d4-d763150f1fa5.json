Here are some prayer points you can consider before commanding evil spirits out:\n\n1. **Confession and Repentance**: Begin by confessing any known sins and asking for God's forgiveness. You might say, \"Heavenly Father, I come before you and confess my sins. Please forgive me and cleanse me from all unrighteousness.\"\n\n2. **Authority in Christ**: Acknowledge the authority you have in Jesus Christ. You can pray, \"In the name of Jesus Christ, I take authority over every evil spirit that has been affecting my life.\"\n\n3. **Protection**: Ask for God's protection as you engage in spiritual warfare. You might say, \"Lord, I ask for your protection and the covering of the blood of Jesus over my life as I command these spirits to leave.\"\n\n4. **Commanding Spirits**: You can then specifically command the spirits to leave. For example, \"I command every spirit of lust, perversion, and any other unclean spirit to leave me now in the name of Jesus Christ.\"\n\n5. **Filling with the Holy Spirit**: Finally, ask God to fill you with His Holy Spirit. You can pray, \"Lord, fill me with your Holy Spirit and help me to walk in your light and truth.\"\n\nFeel free to adapt these points to your personal style of prayer. If you need more specific prayers or guidance, just let me know!"

Ask God to reveal His will for your life and to guide you to the right church and community.\n\n2. **Scripture Reading**: Spend time in the Word of God. Scriptures can provide wisdom and insight. Consider verses like Proverbs 3:5-6, which encourages you to trust in the Lord and acknowledge Him in all your ways.\n\n3. **Seek Counsel**: Talk to trusted spiritual leaders or mentors who can provide guidance and support. They may have insights that can help you in your decision-making.\n\n4. **Community Involvement**: Engage with different church communities and see where you feel most at home. Look for a place where you can grow spiritually and connect with others.\n\n5. **Listen to Your Heart**: Pay attention to your feelings and inclinations. Sometimes, God speaks to us through our desires and passions. \n\n6. **Patience**: Remember that finding the right path can take time. Be patient with yourself and trust that God is leading you.\n\nIf you have specific concerns or need further assistance, feel free to share!"

In this passage, Joshua asks the Lord to make the sun stand still, and God answers his prayer, showcasing His power over nature and His willingness to support His people in their time of need.\n\nUsing this verse in your miracle prayers for job applications is a great way to express your faith in God's ability to intervene and bring about the desired outcomes. It reflects your trust in His timing and sovereignty. Here are a few thoughts on how to incorporate this verse into your prayers:\n\n1. **Boldness in Prayer**: Just as Joshua prayed boldly for the sun to stand still, approach God with confidence, asking Him to intervene in your job applications.\n\n2. **Faith in His Power**: Acknowledge God's power and ability to change circumstances. Remind yourself that nothing is impossible for Him.\n\n3. **Alignment with His Will**: Pray for God's will to be done in your job search. Trust that He knows what is best for you and will guide you to the right opportunities.\n\n4. **Gratitude**: Thank God in advance for His intervention and for the opportunities that are on the way, even if you can't see them yet.\n\nIt's wonderful that you have a specific scripture to anchor your prayers. If you have more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask!"

Here are some additional prayer points inspired by these Psalms:\n\n1. **Seeking Justice**: Just as David called for God to contend with those who oppose him, pray for justice in your own life. Ask God to defend you against any injustices you may be facing.\n\n2. **Protection from Enemies**: David often sought God's protection from his enemies. Pray for God's shield of protection over you and your loved ones, asking Him to guard your hearts and minds.\n\n3. **Deliverance from Fear**: David expressed his fears and sought deliverance. Bring your fears before God and ask for His peace to fill your heart, trusting in His ability to deliver you from any anxiety.\n\n4. **Praise and Thanksgiving**: David frequently praised God for His faithfulness. Take time to thank God for His past deliverances and express your trust in His future provision.\n\n5. **Strength in Trials**: Ask God to give you strength and courage as you face challenges, just as David relied on God's strength during his trials.\n\n6. **Restoration of Joy**: David often prayed for the restoration of joy. If you're feeling down or discouraged, ask God to renew your joy and fill you with His Spirit.\n\n7. **Guidance and Wisdom**: Seek God's guidance in your decisions, asking for wisdom to navigate your circumstances, just as David sought God's direction in his life.\n\nFeel free to adapt these points to fit your specific situation.

Here’s a prayer inviting the Holy Spirit that you can use or adapt as you like:\n\n---\n\n**Prayer Inviting the Holy Spirit**\n\nHeavenly Father, I come before You with a humble heart, seeking Your presence. I invite the Holy Spirit to fill me anew, to guide my thoughts, and to empower my prayers. \n\nHoly Spirit, I ask that You illuminate my mind and open my heart to receive Your wisdom and understanding. Help me to discern Your voice amidst the noise of the world. \n\nAs I pray, let Your peace wash over me, and may Your love flow through me. Strengthen my spirit and help me to walk in Your ways. \n\nThank You for Your presence in my life, for being my comforter and guide. I surrender my will to You and trust in Your perfect plan. \n\nIn Jesus' name, I pray. Amen.\n\n---\n\nFeel free to personalize it further! Playing \"Oceans\" is a beautiful way to set the atmosphere for prayer. If you need anything else, just let me know!"
