We pray against the Spirit of lust within our hearts, minds, and bodies. We renounce all sexual sins and break all curses of lust in the name of Jesus Christ. We command all spirits of lust and perversion to come out of our lives. We present our bodies to you as a living sacrifice and ask for the Spirit of holiness to guide us in sexual purity. Fill us with the power of your Holy Spirit and help us to walk in righteousness. Thank you for your strength and grace. In Jesus' name, Amen.\n\n---\n\nAdditionally, remember to focus on scriptures that encourage you to walk in the Spirit and not fulfill the lust of the flesh. If you need more resources or specific verses, just let me know!"

Then, when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death.\"\n\nThese verses remind us to rely on the Spirit and to abstain from desires that can lead us away from God.
