We come boldly and with confidence. For your Word says that when we confess our sins, you are faithful and forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. Today, we are praying against the Spirit of lust, lust within our hearts, minds, and bodies. We renounce all sexual sins that we have been involved in the past, including fornication, masturbation, pornography, and adultery, in the name of Jesus Christ. \n\nWe break all curses of lust and command all spirits of lust and perversion to come out now. We present our bodies to the Lord as a living sacrifice. We receive the Spirit of holiness in our lives now to walk in sexual purity. Lord, we pray today that we will not let sin reign in our bodies. Fill us with the power of your Holy Spirit.\n\nIn the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.\n\nIf you need further support or resources, feel free to ask!"
