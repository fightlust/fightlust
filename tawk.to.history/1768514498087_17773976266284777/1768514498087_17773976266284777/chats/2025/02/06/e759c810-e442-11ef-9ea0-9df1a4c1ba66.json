We pray against the Spirit of lust and renounce all sexual sins that we have been involved in the past, including fornication, masturbation, and pornography. In the name of Jesus Christ, we break all curses of lust and command all spirits of lust and perversion to come out now. We present our bodies to You as a living sacrifice and ask for Your strength to walk in sexual purity.\n\nLord, we ask for Your help and strength to fill us with the power of Your Holy Spirit. We submit ourselves to You, knowing that in our weakness, You are strong. Thank You for hearing our prayers and delivering us from the tricks of the enemy. In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.\"\n\nIf you would like more specific resources or support, please let me know!"
