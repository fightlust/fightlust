Your Word says that when we confess our sins, you are faithful and forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. Today, we are praying against the Spirit of lust and all other sexual sins. We break all curses of lust and command all spirits of loneliness and perversion to come out in the name of Jesus Christ. We receive the Spirit of holiness in our lives now to walk in sexual purity.\n\nFeel free to use this prayer as a guide, and remember that you can always reach out for support. If you need more specific resources or prayers, just let me know!"
