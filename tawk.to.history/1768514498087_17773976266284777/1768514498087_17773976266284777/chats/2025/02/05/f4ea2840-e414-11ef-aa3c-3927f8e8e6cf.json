God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation, he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.\"\n\n2. **Psalm 119:11** - \"I have stored up your word in my heart, that I might not sin against you.\"\n\n3. **Philippians 4:13** - \"I can do all things through him who strengthens me.\"\n\n4. **James 4:7** - \"Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.\"\n\n5. **Romans 12:2** - \"Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.\"\n\nThese verses can help guide you and remind you of God's promises. Would you like to discuss any of these further?"
