      "msg": "I’m really glad you reached out. What you’re going through is something many people face, and you’re not alone. When lust starts coming back and prayer feels distant or hard, it’s not a sign that you’ve failed—it’s a signal that you need to lean more fully into Christ, not run from Him.\n\nThe enemy wants to convince you that you’re stuck or beyond help, but that’s a lie. Jesus hasn’t left you. He is still interceding for you, and His Spirit is still working in you, even when it doesn’t feel like it. You don’t have to have perfect words or feel strong to pray. Just whisper His name. Start with honesty—“Jesus, I’m tired. I don’t know what to say.” That’s enough. The Holy Spirit fills in the gaps when you can’t express yourself. That’s Romans 8:26 in action.\n\nRemember, your identity isn’t based on how strong your willpower is. It’s based on what Jesus has done for you. He already overcame this, and He offers you His victory. Your job is to stay close—abide in Him. Even if you’re weak, stay in the Word, stay honest, and keep showing up in prayer, even if it feels dry. Don’t wait to feel spiritual—just come as you are. Over time, the dryness will break.\n\nYou are not beyond help. You are not disqualified. You are in a battle, but the One who fights for you is stronger than the enemy you face. Let me know if you want a specific prayer or if you’d like to be connected to someone who can walk with you personally. You’re not doing this alone.m"
