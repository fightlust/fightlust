Cast me not away from your presence, and take not Your Holy Spirit from me. Restore to me the joy of Your salvation, and uphold me with a willing spirit.\"\n\n3. **Romans 8:1** - \"There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.\"\n\n4. **Psalm 139:23-24** - \"Search me, O God, and know my heart! Try me and know my thoughts! And see if there be any grievous way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting!\"\n\nThese verses remind us of God's love, forgiveness, and the importance of seeking Him. If you need more specific guidance or prayers, let me know!"
