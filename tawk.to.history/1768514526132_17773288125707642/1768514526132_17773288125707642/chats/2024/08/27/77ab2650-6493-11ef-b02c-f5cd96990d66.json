I renounce all ties to lust, adultery, and any impure thoughts. Please cleanse my body, soul, and spirit from all defilement. Fill me with Your holiness and guide my thoughts to be pure and aligned with Your will.\"\n\n2. **Scripture for Strength**: \n   - **1 Corinthians 6:19-20**: \"Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies.\"\n   - **Philippians 4:8**: \"Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things.\"\n\n3. **Prayer for Your Partners**: \n   \"Lord, I lift up all my past partners to You. I pray for their healing and cleansing as well. May Your grace touch their lives and lead them to repentance and restoration.\"\n\nFeel free to adapt these prayers to your personal feelings and situation.
