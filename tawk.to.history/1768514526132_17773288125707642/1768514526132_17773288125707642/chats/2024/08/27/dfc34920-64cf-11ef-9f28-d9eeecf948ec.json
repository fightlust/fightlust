Here are a few scriptures that can encourage you in your pursuit of God and finding freedom:\n\n1. **Psalm 63:1** - \"O God, You are my God; earnestly I seek You; my soul thirsts for You, my body longs for You, in a dry and weary land where there is no water.\"\n   \n2. **John 8:36** - \"So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.\"\n\n3. **Romans 12:1-2** - \"Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God—this is your true and proper worship. Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.\"\n\n4. **Philippians 4:13** - \"I can do all this through him who gives me strength.\"\n\nThese verses remind us of the importance of seeking God and relying on His strength.
