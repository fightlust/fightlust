Romans 12:2 encourages us to be \"transformed by the renewing of your mind.\" This renewal comes through the Holy Spirit, who can soften your heart and restore your sensitivity to God's voice.\n\nIt's a process that involves sincere repentance, seeking God's forgiveness, and allowing His Word to guide and change you. Philippians 2:13 reminds us, \"for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.\"\n\nWould you like to discuss specific steps or resources that can help you in this journey?"
