I come boldly and with confidence, for Your Word says that when we confess our sins, You are faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness (1 John 1:9). \n\nLord, I ask You to search my heart for areas that displease You. Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me (Psalm 51:10-13). I confess and repent of my specific sins, and I ask for Your forgiveness and cleansing. \n\nThank You, Lord, for Your faithfulness and for the forgiveness You offer. In Jesus' name, Amen.\n\nIf you need further support or resources, feel free to ask!"
