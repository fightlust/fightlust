Help us to overcome any feelings of laziness and to be diligent in our tasks. Remind us that we can do all things through Christ who strengthens us. \n\nAs for scripture, I encourage you to reflect on Proverbs 13:4: \"The soul of a lazy man desires, and has nothing; but the soul of the diligent shall be made rich.\" \n\nMay this verse inspire you to seek diligence and purpose in your daily life. If you need further support or specific prayers, feel free to let me know!"
