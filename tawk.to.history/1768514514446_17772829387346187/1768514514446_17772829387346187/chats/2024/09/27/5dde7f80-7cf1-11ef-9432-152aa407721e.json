Here are a few scriptures that can encourage you in your journey towards a holy lifestyle:\n\n1. **1 Peter 1:16** - \"Be holy, because I am holy.\"\n2. **Romans 12:1-2** - \"Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God—this is your true and proper worship.\"\n3. **Philippians 4:8** - \"Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things.\"\n\nFor prayers, you might consider asking God for strength and guidance in your daily life. Here’s a simple prayer you can use:\n\n\"Dear Lord, I ask for Your strength to live a life that is pleasing to You. Help me to turn away from sin and to focus on what is holy and pure. Guide my thoughts and actions, and fill me with Your Spirit. Amen.\"\n\nIf you need more specific resources or support, feel free to let me know!"
